# CMDLinux: A basic, linux-like operating system userspace for windows
###### Version 2.2.1
## Welcoem to CMDLinux!
Cmdlinux is an open-source, compact, and familiar linux-style command userspace for windows.
CMDLinux was inspired by the reimplementations of GNU utilities and other things done by cygwin, etc.
## Things that work:
* startup again
* The SH (esque) shell
* command detection
* application execution
* documentation files
* some form of a login system
* adding users
* basic user rights access
* basic filesystem commands
* parts of the package manager



## Things that don't:

* text editing (need to find nano for windows).
* removing users that you added (use rm-d for now).
* Everything else


## Build instructions:
Simply clone the repository, then run init from the repo's working dir.
Enjoy!
