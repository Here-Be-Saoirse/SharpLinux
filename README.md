# SharpLinux: A linux-like operating system userspace for windows
## Welcome to SharpLinux!
SharpLinux is an open-source, compact, and familiar linux-style command userspace for windows.
It was inspired by the reimplementations of GNU utilities and other things done by cygwin, etc. It may never (and will never) be as feature-complete, but it wasn't designed to be.
Note: source tree is in /usr/share/src to comply with the FHS.
## Things that work:
* the init binary
* The shell - /bin/tsh
* command detection
* application execution
* some basic filesystem commands



## Things that don't:

* Everything else


## Build instructions:
Simply clone (or download the zip of) the repository, then run init from the repo's working dir.
Default Logins: (change these *IMMEDIATELY*!):
* Root: alpine
* amy: riversong

Enjoy!
